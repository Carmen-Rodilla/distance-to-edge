# distance-to-edge
Custom Python code used to quantify the distance between different Golgi-localized proteins. 
The input data for which this script was build consists on a .xlsx file that contains the line profile data of two-color images, obtained with ImageJ. 
For a proper run of the programme, the columns have to be distributed as: 

MAX-TO-EDGE

In consecutive columns:

DISTANCE CHANNEL ARF-INTENSITY CHANNEL ARF - DISTANCES CHANNEL vesicle - INTENSITY CHANNEL vesicle - AGAIN 

For more than one box profile processed, add them consecutively in the next column.


EDGE-TO-EDGE

In consecutive columns:


DISTANCE CHANNEL ARF-INTENSITY CHANNEL ARF - DISTANCES CHANNEL marker - INTENSITY CHANNEL marker - AGAIN 


For more than one box profile processed, add them consecutively in the next column.
